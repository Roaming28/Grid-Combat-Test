# Grid-Combat-Test
A turn-based combat system developed in the Unity Engine, inspired by JRPG games like "Live-A-Live" and "Final Fantasy". Players control a character who can move and perform actions on the battlefield. The battlefield is a grid structure (much like a chess board). Different attacks and moves have different patterns. The player must strategise with their characters moveset to outsmart and defeat an enemy. 

Features Complete:
-Grid Creation Tool that works within Unity. It is a GUI that allows a user to setup and define different grid structures to define in game battlefields and player move patterns. The user can then save this as a JSON file to be used in other parts of production.
-Grid initialisation. Takes a JSON previously made and prroduces a game battlefield with player/enemy spawns, obstacles, status effects on squares, etc.
-Player move/attack implementtion usin the grid JSON files.
-Player statistics and layout design. Things like equipment, weapons numbers, health, stamina, etc.

In Progress:
-Turn system that allows a fight to play out turn by turn.
-UI for player decisions.
-Enemy AI. Currently the enemy just makes a preset choice.

Currently in still in development.
